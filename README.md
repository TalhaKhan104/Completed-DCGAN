# Completed-DCGAN
This is a DCGAN nerual network that generates hand written digits using the MNIST dataset for handwritten digits.
This code is for python and tensorflow and leverages a generator and Discriminator model, 
Dense and convolutional layers where used, Leaky ReLU activation was used, SIgmoid cross entropy was used as the loss function
and ADAM was the optimizer.

The model is trained for 50 epochs, contains batch normalization and dropout to account for overfitting and generated hand written digits with 88 percent accurace.
